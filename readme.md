2. Mongoose â€“ install in every new project (npm i mongoose).
3. Other auth packages â€“ bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, cors, dotenv, cookie-parser, nodemailer.
4. Nodemon â€“ install locally (npm i --save-dev nodemon) and add "dev": "nodemon server.js" in scripts.
5. .env file â€“ store your Atlas connection string (remove last / if adding DB name in code).
6. Compass â€“ paste full Atlas string (with slash) to connect.
No need to run mongod locally if using Atlas.
